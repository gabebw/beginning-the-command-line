# I/O Redirection

Text streams are the common language of Unix. You're not fluent in Unix unless
you can redirect them.

`>` directs output to a file (which, in true Unix fashion, can be a "file" like
/dev/null).

    $ cat foo
    hello
    $ echo goodbye > foo
    $ cat foo
    goodbye

You'll note that `>` overwrote the contents of the `foo`, and that "goodbye"
wasn't outputted to standard output, since it went into `foo`.


## >>

`>>` works exactly the same as `>`, except it appends:

    $ cat foo
    hello
    $ echo goodbye >> foo
    $ cat foo
    hello
    goodbye

## <

Combinations of `>` and `<` often look odd and are hard to parse:

    $ cat foo < input > output

That line could use a better command than `cat` and also I don't understand it.
