# Get better at UNIX

This repo is a demonstrative set of files meant to train you to be better at
UNIX.

## How to Play

* Fork the repo
* Read the first challenge, in `1.md`
* All challenges assume that you are in the `demo/` folder.
* When you figure out how to complete it, make a commit detailing what commands you ran:
  `[1] ls *`. If the command doesn't fit on one line, make it part of the text
  of the commit message, as detailed [here](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
