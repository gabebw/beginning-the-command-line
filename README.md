# Get better at UNIX

This repo is a demonstrative set of files meant to train you to be better at
UNIX.

## How to Play

* Fork the repo
* Read the first challenge, in `1.md`
* All challenges assume that you are in the `demo/` folder.
* When you figure out how to complete it, make a commit detailing what commands you ran:
  `[1] ls *`. If the command doesn't fit on one line, make it part of the text
  of the commit message, as detailed [here](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).
* Move on to `2.md`.
* Rinse and repeat.

## More info

Each challenge builds on previous ones, and each one introduces only one new
concept. If you've mastered challenge N and you know how to use `man`, then you
can do challenge N+1.
