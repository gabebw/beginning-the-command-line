# Get better at UNIX

This repo is a demonstrative set of files meant to train you to be better at
UNIX. Every challenge is something I use often or have found to be very useful
in day-to-day programming.

## How to Play

* Fork the repo
* Read the first challenge, in `1.md`
* All challenges assume that you are in the `demo/` folder.
* When you figure out how to complete it, make a commit detailing what commands
  you ran. See the "Commit format" section below for guidelines.
* Move on to `2.md`.
* Rinse and repeat.

## Commit format

* First line: "Completing challenge N."
* Second line: blank.
* Third-last lines: Detail the commands you ran, following the bulleted list in
  the challenge.

Follow the format [here](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html).

Sample:

    Finished challenge 1.

    * ls --foo
    * ls -1 \
         --foo \
         --bar \
    * ls --bar -H

## More info

Each challenge builds on previous ones, and each one introduces only one new
concept. If you've mastered challenge N and you know how to use `man`, then you
can do challenge N+1.

## Does the name of this repo refer to anything?

Why yes! It refers to a Neal Stephenson essay called "In the Beginning was the
Command Line". To download it, [go here](http://www.cryptonomicon.com/beginning.html).
